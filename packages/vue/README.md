Pepicons is an icon-set of around five hundred (and counting) retro icons inspired by the 80's.
Every icon available in 2 variants: Pop! and Print ‚ùè

@pepicons/vue is the Vue wrapper for this icon library. Only supports Vue 3!

## Installation & Usage

```
npm i @pepicons/vue
```

You must import the Pepicon component locally wherever you want to use them, as per the example below:

```js
// import what you need
import { Pepicon } from '@pepicons/vue'

// add to local components where you use it:
export default {
  components: { Pepicon },
}
```

We do not support Vue's `install(Plugin)` out of principle: Anything that is "auto-magical" is not considered good practice; It's more difficult to trace down where a component is coming from.

Using `Pepicon` component will use the `async` version of the icons, which means each icon is defined as an async Vue component, and loaded on demand when it's rendered.

If you want a sync version of the icon components, you can also import them individually, as per the example below:

```js
import { PopAirplane, PrintArrowDown } from '@pepicons/vue'
```
